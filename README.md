cedarOS
=======
This project has been considered as defunct. Due to the "unforseen" difficulties of creating a full-blown operating system in the likes of macOs or even Ubuntu's Linux are seemingly impossible for one person to achieve with the complexity of modern hardware and microcode. This may be revisited in the future in my downtime, but it was foolish of me to think I could create a competing OS to macOS singlehandedly.

This OS runs on the [Linux Kernel][1]

Goals/Expectations
==================
* This OS is not a fork or customized / modified version of any current distribution, it has been **created from scratch.**
* Its goal is to be **fast, easy to use, bug-free, featureful and portable** as much as possible.
